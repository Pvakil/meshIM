     * This query is used by {@link io.left.meshim.adapters.UserMessageListAdapter}. That adapter
     * populates a tab in {@link MainActivity} which shows a list of
     * conversations that have been had with other meshIM users in the past.
     *
     * <p>
     *     This query returns a list of {@link ConversationSummary}s, which contain the four fields
     *     needed to populate a list item in that list: the username and avatar for the user the
     *     conversation is with, and the message and timestamp of the most recent message exchanged
     *     with that user.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     *     This first thing this query does is create a subquery, which shrinks the Messages table
     *     down to just the most recent message exchanged with each person a message has been
     *     exchanged with. This is achieved by creating  `PeerID`, which maps to a `User.UserID`
     *     of a user a message has been exchanged with. `PeerID` is created by shrinking each
     *     `RecipientID`/`SenderID` pairdown to just the UserID that isn't this device's user. Since
     *     the latter is always 1, the other user's ID will always be greater in value, so we use
     *     `max(RecipientID, SenderID)` to acquire the foreign party in the pair. Finally, we use
     *     `MAX(Timestamp) AS Timestamp` and `GROUP BY PeerID` to filter the table down to the most
     *     recent message for each peer.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     *     With the messages sorted, we do an inner join on the Users table where PeerID = UserID in
     *     order to get the information for the user we've had the conversation with. We go in this
     *     direction because we will not have exchanged a message with every user in the
     *     Users table.
     * </p>
     * @return a summary of every conversation the device's user has started
